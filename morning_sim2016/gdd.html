            <h2>1	Game overview</h2>
            <p>Our game is going to be about your average school morning. The little mishaps and encounters with passers-by and fellow commuters. Each one of us does sometimes something a little goofy while sleep deprived. So we’re going to tell you your own story, possibly with small twist(s).</p>
            <h3>1.1	Game concept</h3>
            <p>The game, of course, will be a text based adventure. It is going to be done with python language. There will be multiple choices and blank text fields for you to fill.</p>
            <h3>1.2	Feature set</h3>
            <p>The game is going to be pretty normal text based adventure. Game should recognize one and two word commands and progress by the choices of the player. There is also a little narrative going on the side. It tells you about the surroundings and events happening at the current location of the player. Our little adventure is going to have a little extra though. These extra features are explained in a little more detail below.</p>
            <h4>1.2.1	Karma-meter</h4>
            <p>Our game is going to feature a little mechanic called karma. You might recognize it from the buddhist teaching and that gives you a pretty good general idea! The karma-meter fills or empties a little based on your actions and choices. For example you might brew some coffee for your roommate and the meter fills. Or you might be greedy and not help a child to buy a bus ticket and the meter empties.</p>
            <h4>1.2.2	Clock</h4>
            <p>Another feature in the game is going to be a clock. You have to make it to school in time after all. The clock is counting down during the game and there is no way to get more time… Your action affect the speed the clock goes down though. If you decide to talk to random stranger, you lose time. If you rather take a tram than walk to school, you save a little time and so on.</p>
            <h3>1.3	Genre</h3>
            <p>Your journey to school will be set in modern day Helsinki and one might call it a simulator or an adventure. That’s really up to you and your worldview. Realism is hopefully a word we can use to describe the ready product, but we’re not making any promises yet! As for genre, the game should be found at least a little amusing. So comedy maybe?</p>
            <h3>1.4	Target audience</h3>
            <p>We didn’t want to exclude anyone so the target audience is basically everyone. The game itself doesn’t contain any direct usage of alcohol or violence but there might be some vague hints…</p>
            <h3>1.5	Locations</h3>
            <p>Locations of the adventure feature the ordinary locations that an average student passes through during their school trip. There are of course a few detours that definitely are not part of the school trip of an honourable student… One might find oneself to be in a weird place after all if the star are in the right position. The complete list of the locations can be found below.</p>
            <h4>1.5.1	Home</h4>
            <p>The starting point of the game. Your cozy little student apartment. You live with a roommate as most of the typical Finnish students do. You get along fairly well. You have a coffee brewer.</p>
            <h4>1.5.2	Bus stop</h4>
            <p>Closest public transportation stop to your home. The player lives in a relatively peaceful neighbourhood so one doesn’t have to fear for their life whilst waiting for a bus. You might make some weird acquaintances though...</p>
            <h4>1.5.3	Bus</h4>
            <p>You’ve finally gotten into a bus and your journey to school has begun. Hopefully you make it in time! As a finn you also hope that you can sit alone… Talking to someone in a bus is horrible, isn’t it?</p>
            <h4>1.5.4	Railway station</h4>
            <p>The other alternative for going to school. Railway station is a little further from your apartment than the bus stop but the train is generally faster way of transportation. At least on the ideal days...</p>
            <h4>1.5.5	Train</h4>
            <p>The train you take to school comes from Vantaa. As a person born and raised in Helsinki you can’t help but to feel a little anxiety towards denizens of Vantaa. They seem like an unpredictable bunch to you.</p>
            <h4>1.5.6	Streets of Helsinki</h4>
            <p>You’ve finally made it to the central Helsinki. Now all you’ve got to do is to walk to the tram stop or walk to school. If you decide to be active and walk to school you have to be wary of fundraisers and beggars. Dodging Amnesty fundraisers is an exhausting mission though...</p>
            <h4>1.5.7	Tram stop</h4>
            <p>Your destination is Bulevardi so the tram stop is filled with elderly people. One doesn’t simply live in southern Helsinki during their pre pension life… Elderly people are generally peaceful but they seem to like to share their stories eagerly.</p>
            <h4>1.5.8	Tram</h4>
            <p>Lovely and warm tram number 6. You don’t have to walk through the snowy streets and get annoyed by people asking for money. Unfortunately a random drunk has taken the same tram and he senses your poverty and begins a conversation.</p>
            <h4>1.5.9	Car</h4>
            <p>You’re in luck! Your roommate is from a rich family and has a car. If you made the correct choices during your morning haziness at home, he’s sure to give you a ride to school. You feel your stress dissolving while sitting on the front bench of a nice car listening to good music.</p>
            <h4>1.5.10	Unnamed bar</h4>
            <p>Tough luck you missed your first class… What does a good student do? Does he arrive a little late or does he go to a bar? It really is up to you. One might say that a pint of beer eases the stress.</p>
            <h4>1.5.11	School building</h4>
            <p>You’ve made it to Bulevardi! Unfortunately that isn’t enough. You have to get to your home class in time. You see a fairly familiar face on the school yard. Do you think you can refrain yourself from small talking with him? Or the cute girl you met last week in the student party?</p>
            <h4>1.5.12	Home class</h4>
            <p>Objective completed. You made it to home class. Are you on time? That is really up to how you played the game… If you’re in luck there is still some coffee in the pot and time to pour some before the class starts. Alternatively you’re late, teacher sarcastically greets you and you get teasing smirks and comments from your classmates. Anyways this is the end of your journey, regardless of the outcome. Congrats or better luck next time.</p>
 
 

            <h2>2	Gameplay and mechanics</h2>
            <h3>2.1	Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Gameplay of a text based adventure is of course a pretty straightforward concept. Player makes decisions in the game with text inputs and the game progresses. The game is able to recognize one and two word inputs and tries to give the player a text based description of the events unfolding based on the choices.</p>
            <h3>2.2	Game progression</h3>
            <p>Game progression is achieved via different decisions. You have to take the clock into account too. We’re really busy people after all. One doesn’t have time to waste during their youth… Each “level” or location, if you prefer, has a few different events that affect your trip time.</p> 
            <h3>2.3	NPCs</h3>
            <p>Morning sim features a number of non-player-characters. They affect your journey in both negative and positive ways. Almost each location in the game has at least one NPC. They have to be dealt with if you want to make progress. Different choices in the game affect the NPCs.</p>
            <h4>2.3.1	Home</h4>
            <p>You live with a roommate. So of course he’s home during the morning. Your roommate is from a wealthy family and has a car. If you brew him some coffee you get on his good side and he might take you to school. Your roommate might not always interact with you in the morning so a car ride is not guaranteed.</p>
            <h4>2.3.2	Bus stop</h4>
            <p>If you make it to the bus stop you encounter a child who misses 40 cents from a bus ticket. You have an option to help the child buy the ticket and that affects positively to your karma. Because of your student status, your cash is limited and buying the ticket might affect you later on.</p>
            <h4>2.3.3	Bus</h4>
            <p>If you helped the child buy the ticket, a middle-aged commuter sits next to you and commends your altruism. He offers to buy you coffee when you get to central Helsinki. You can take him up on his offer and lose some time, and get free coffee, or politely decline the offer and be on your way to school on time. If you didn’t help the child, you get to sit alone but feel the judging stares from a suit wearing middle aged man across the aisle.</p>
            <h4>2.3.4	Railway station</h4>
            <p>It’s morning so it’s of course a rush hour. Railway station is filled with people coming and going. There are no interactable NPCs in the railway station.</p> 
            <h4>2.3.5	Train</h4>
            <p>Filled with commuters from Vantaa. Your facial expression is a little frightened. A drunk notices your fear and comes to beg you for money. You have an option to tell the drunk off or give him the money. Your karma won’t go down even if you don’t give the drunk money. If you do give him the money you will notice the effects later on in your journey.</p>
            <h4>2.3.6	Streets of Helsinki</h4>
            <p>You’ve arrived to the central. Now you’ve got to decide whether to trek to school or walk to the tram stop. If you take the sporty way, you will encounter an Amnesty fundraiser. She will blabber about some humanistic stuff you don’t care too much about. You can ignore her by taking a little detour or you can engage in a conversation and politely as possible tell her that your monetary situation is not that good and you can’t help her cause. Of course the detour option eats away your time.</p>
            <h4>2.3.7	Tram stop</h4>
            <p>Alternative for walking to school is going there by tram. If you take the tram, you have to buy a ticket. If you gave money to the drunk in the train or helped the child to buy a ticket at the bus stop, you won’t have cash anymore to buy a tram ticket. If you have high amount of karma, you won’t encounter ticket inspectors in the tram. If, on the other hand, you’ve been selfish, you’ll get the lovely inspection fee added on top of your invoice pile...</p>
            <h4>2.3.8	Tram</h4>
            <p>As mentioned above, you might encounter ticket inspector in the tram if your karma is low. If you do have money to buy the ticket, you will have a pleasant chat with an elderly lady. She will talk to you about the Helsinki she grew up in in the 50’s. If your karma is high, you will notice the correct stop. Otherwise you’ll continue to listen to the lady and miss your stop.</p>
            <h4>2.3.9	Car</h4>
            <p>You had the option to brew some coffee in the morning. If you did that and other good deeds, you’re roommate notices you in the streets of Helsinki and takes you to school in his car. To get the comfortable car ride, you have to do all the good deeds during your trip.</p>
            <h4>2.3.10	Unnamed bar</h4>
            <p>If you feel like everything is lost and don’t want to go to school late, you have to option to go to a certain bar close to school. This will be an alternative goal. You can’t go to school if you got to the bar. Patrons in the bar will give you weird looks. You will spend the remaining morning sipping your beverage and dodging the cue stick in the corner table. What a miserable morning...</p>
            <h4>2.3.11	School building</h4>
            <p>You’re almost at the destination. There is only a little to go now. You meet with an acquaintance in the lobby and can’t help but to have a little chat. If you still have time on your clock, this shouldn’t be a problem. If you don’t, you’ll have to go to the class late or make your way to the bar. If you’ve no karma left, you will find a painting on the school yard. You have the option to go and examine it. Although you’re no art student you recognize the painting. The moment you recognize it, an armed police unit comes and takes you into custody. You are suspect in an art robbery case. Say bye to you making it in time for class.</p>
            <h4>2.3.12	Home class</h4>
            <p>Mission accomplished. Were you late or not, you’re in class now. Depending on the time remaining, you might get some teasing from your classmates.</p>
